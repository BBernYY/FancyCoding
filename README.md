# Utils
This is the custom utility module that i use for testing and timing.
## Functions
There are currently two functions in this module.
* test(a, b)
* timing.start(), timing.stop()
I count the second start and stop functions as one.
### test
I use this to check if outputs are equal, which is useful for debugging.
### timing
I use this to time my code to find any slow parts.
